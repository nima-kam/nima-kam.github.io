I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran, following a bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). My studies have centered around machine learning, computer vision, and generative models, and I’ve also explored areas like cognitive science and video analysis. Over the years, I've gained experience both in academic research and industry, working on projects that span from image synthesis to behavior recognition.

Much of my work has focused on generative models, especially for image generation and manipulation. I enjoy developing tools and techniques that turn raw data into new and practical applications—whether it's creating novel images, designing intelligent systems, or building solutions that can transform existing processes. For me, the main drive is to use technology not just to understand data, but to actively shape and build new possibilities with it.
